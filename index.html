        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm a coding rookie whose's just learning the basics of Html and CSS. I've always wondered how sites were made and designed, so this is kinda of a learning experience for me. I have been complimented on my writing skills which I believe will translate well into coding.</p>
        <p>My intrest in coding comes from my love of browsing the internet and video games. They have impacted my life so much to the point where i've decided I wanted to become apart of the process.</p>
